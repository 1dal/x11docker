 The image should contain an OpenGL implementation to profit from it. \n
 The easiest way to achieve this is to install package \"mesa-utils\" in your image. \n
 \n
 To use the benefits of hardware accelerated 3D graphics, you need to have \n 
 a graphics card driver matching the one on your host to be installed in your docker image. \n
 As for general, a package from xserver-xorg-video-* and maybe linux-firmware-nonfree \n
 may be useful, depending on your host hardware. \n
 If you have a proprietary driver on your host, most probably you need this in your image, too. \n
 \n
 To achieve hardware acceleration, x11docker provides host devices found in /dev/dri \n
 to the image. This may be considered to be a security leak. \n
 \n
 As for now, only core X server provides hardware accelerated 3D / OpenGL rendering. \n
 \n
 To check if hardware acceleration is enabled, you can run \"glxinfo | grep renderer\". \n
 The OpenGL renderer string should contain your graphics card adapter name. \n
 If the renderer string contains \"llvmpipe\", only software rendering is enabled. \n
 As a performance check, you can run glxgears in a maximized window.

\n
Create a new X server & run GUI applications and desktop environments from inside of docker images, \n
and show them on your display.\n
Useful to avoid security issues concerning X forwarding. \n
Does not have any dependencies inside of docker images. \n
\n
x11docker and x11docker-gui are published under MIT licence. \n
Look for it on github: https://github.com/mviereck/x11docker\n
Some example images can be found on https://hub.docker.com/u/x11docker/ \n
\n
Dependencies: \n
Depending on choosed options, x11docker needs some packages to be installed. \n
It will check for them on startup and show terminal messages if some are missing. \n
List of possible needed packages: \n
\n
xpra xephyr xvfb xclip kaptain wmctrl pulseaudio docker.io xorg\n 
\n
If using xpra or Xephyr, the dockered applications will appear on your already running X display. \n
(Then you need no tty switching, and x11-common does not need to be changed.)\n
\n
If using core X server, first run <dpkg-reconfigure x11-common> and choose option <anybody>. \n
Otherwise it is not allowed to start a new core X server from within an already running X.\n
You can switch between displays using <STRG><ALT><F7>...<F12>.\n
\n
On systems without a root password, like Ubuntu or Sparky, use option --sudo.\n
\n
For troubleshooting, acivate option --VERBOSE and run x11docker-gui from within a terminal.\n
\n
To see all options and more informations, type in your terminal <x11docker --help>, and have a look at github.
